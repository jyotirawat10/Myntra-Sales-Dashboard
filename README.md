🏆 Project: Myntra Sales Dashboard
📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Myntra's sales data and create an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides valuable insights into:

Key Performance Indicator Key Insights:
Top-Selling Categories & Brands:
Men's and Women's categories dominate sales, followed by Beauty and Kids.
H&M, Roadster, Puma, Adidas, and Allen Solly are the top-selling brands.

Revenue Trends:
Revenue peaked in March 2023 (~₹96K), showing a strong upward trend.
A decline in January 2023 suggests seasonality (post-festive drop).

Customer Demographics:
The average customer age is 27 years, with most shoppers aged between 21-33 years.
Top cities with the highest purchases: Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Prayagraj, Patiala, and Jaipur.

Effect of Discounts on Sales:
Orders with 30%-50% discounts generated the highest revenue (~₹1M).
Surprisingly, discounts above 50% had lower total revenue, possibly due to fewer high-discount items.
